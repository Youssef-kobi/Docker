## Introduction

Docker-1 is a project that provides hands-on experience in working with Docker, a popular containerization technology. Participants gain practical knowledge and skills in using Docker to create and manage containers, as well as understanding the basic concepts of containerization.

Through a series of tasks, participants learn how to install Docker on their system, build Docker images from Dockerfiles, create and run containers, and manage containers using Docker commands. They also gain experience in configuring and networking containers, using volumes and bind mounts to manage persistent data, and deploying applications to Docker containers.

Docker-1 provides valuable experience in several key areas of containerization, including:

- Creating Docker images and containers
- Configuring and networking containers
- Managing persistent data with volumes and bind mounts
- Deploying applications to Docker containers

Successful completion of Docker-1 provides a valuable addition to a portfolio, demonstrating knowledge and proficiency in working with Docker and containerization.
